I wanna spend all my minutes on you
I wanna go to the top of the room
I wanna take every second I can
Showing you gently just how lucky I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
I don't care about they be sayin', sayin'
They don't even what they be sayin', sayin'
Yeah
Now we gotta watch, now we gotta move
Actually, we don't, we can just cruise
Up to Ravello, overlookin' the Amalfi
Champagne toastin', feelin' real bossy
Spend a couple days then I call Phillip
That's my pilot, wait for him to fill-up
The jet then we jet to the Santorini sunset
Then Spain, we ain't even done yet (facts)
I wanna spend all my minutes on you
I wanna go to the top of the room
I wanna take every second I can
Showing you gently just how lucky I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
Maybe Mexico, Switzerland with snow
Maybe we should go right now
Desert with the stars, I'll take you to Mars
Maybe we should go right now
Let's go to Rome, maybe let's just stay home
Baby, accept we poppin' and that everyone knows
Pictures in France, then we fly to Japan
Baby, accept we poppin' and let everyone know, know, know
I wanna spend all my minutes on you
I wanna go to the top of the room
I wanna take every second I can
Showing you gently just how lucky I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, lucky
